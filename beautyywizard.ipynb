    "This capstone project synthesizes multiple exploratory and pipeline notebooks into a single, end-to-end analysis aligned with data analysis capstone requirements. The objective is to examine cosmetic product formulations, ingredient usage patterns, and regulatory risk signals by integrating retail product data, ingredient hazard sources, and government chemical reporting into a relational SQLite database.\n",
